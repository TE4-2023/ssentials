# Project
This website is meant to demonstrate how a website could be laid out to accomodate for both student and school administrators and teachers.
Its purpose is to combine both essential school activity features such as attendance and things like being able to send in documents for 
assignments all on the same website. Please observe that this website has no functionality as it is only meant to show the user interface 
concept for how it could look. This project was made in school during week 45, 2023.
